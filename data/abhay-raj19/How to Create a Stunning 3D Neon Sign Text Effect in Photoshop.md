## Step 1: Download and Install the GraphicRiver 3D Neon Sign Text Effect 6394012
 
The first thing you need to do is to download and install the GraphicRiver 3D Neon Sign Text Effect 6394012[^1^]. You can purchase it from GraphicRiver for $8. Once you download it, you will get a ZIP file that contains a PSD file and a PDF file. The PSD file is the main file that you will use to create your neon sign text effect. The PDF file is a user guide that explains how to use the add-on.
 
To install the add-on, simply unzip the ZIP file and open the PSD file in Photoshop. You will see a document with several layers and folders. The layers are named and organized according to their functions. You will only need to edit the layer called "Your Text Here".
 
## Step 2: Edit Your Text
 
The next step is to edit your text. To do this, double-click on the layer called "Your Text Here". This will open a new document with your text in a smart object. You can edit your text using the type tool (T). You can change the font, size, color, alignment, and spacing of your text as you wish. You can also use shapes or logos instead of text if you want.
 
Once you are happy with your text, save and close the smart object document. This will update your text in the main document. You will see your text transformed into a 3D neon sign with a default material and perspective.
 
## Step 3: Customize Your Neon Sign
 
The final step is to customize your neon sign. To do this, you can use the folders and layers in the main document. You can choose between 6 different materials for your neon sign: plain style, wood style, bricks style, concrete style, rustic metal style, and chalkboard style. To change the material, simply turn on or off the visibility of the folders named after each material.
 
You can also choose between 3 different perspectives for your neon sign: top view, center view, and bottom view. To change the perspective, simply turn on or off the visibility of the folders named after each perspective.
 
Finally, you can customize the colors, brightness, and glow of your neon sign using the adjustment layers inside each material folder. You can adjust the hue/saturation, levels, curves, gradient map, color balance, and exposure of your neon sign as you like.
